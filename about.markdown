Hello, thank you for visiting my page.

My name is <strong>RachaelMiki1215</strong>.  
I am a self-taught coding/programming hobbyist.  
Currently, I mostly work with C# and HTML/CSS/Javascript.  
(And as you see here by this subpar website, I'm really struggling with web development.)

I've created this page to showcase my projects.
