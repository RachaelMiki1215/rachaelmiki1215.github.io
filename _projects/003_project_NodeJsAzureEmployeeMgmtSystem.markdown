This project is a *fairly minimalistic* employee management system web app created for a job interview prompt.  
It is created using Node.js + Express.js and is hosted on MS Azure App Services as a web application.  

## Current Features
The following features/items exist as of now:
* Check employees registered under each manager (director)
* Add employee

I am not sure if I will update this at all in the future, however anyways it was a good entry way for fullstack development.
