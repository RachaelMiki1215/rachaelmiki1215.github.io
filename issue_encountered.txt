1. Cannot override css style w/ folder asset/css/style.scss.
    --> Turns out you need to mimic the structure of the main css file inside _site/assets.
        In my case, this was _site/assets/main.css, so I needed to create assets/main.scss in root dir.
2. Cannot remove "Home" from navigation bar.
    --> Added new parameter "show-on-navbar" to frontmatter YAML.
        In _includes/top-navbar.html, filtered pages w/ default template based on such criteria.
3. Want to list projects on portfolio page and have individual pages for each project.
    --> In _config.yml, added the following section -
            collections:
                projects
        Under root dir, created new folder named "_projects" to store individual project markdown docs.
        In _layouts, created new template "project_items.html" to use for individual project pages.
        Modified default template so that the side navbar is not included.
        Created new template for portfolio top page which lists out the projects on sidenav.
4. Want to highlight the page/section user is currently viewing in top & side navbar.
    --> Implemented Liquid Template Language If logic so that if the url of the current page contains the url of that navbar link, then item is highlighted.
5. Want to put Gravatar prof img on About page.
    --> There is no direct way to pull Gravatar prof img.
        Use https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-avatar.
